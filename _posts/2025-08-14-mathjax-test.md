This is a test post for MathJax.

Here is an inline equation: \(E = mc^2\) $$E = mc^2$$ \\(E=mc^2\\) $E=mc^2$

Here is a display equation:

\[f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz\]

$$f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz$$


$$
f(a) = \frac{1}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{z-a} dz
$$
